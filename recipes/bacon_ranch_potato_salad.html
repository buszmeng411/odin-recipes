    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the easiest recipe because it can be altered in so many ways. Add a little taco seasoning to spice it up -- or you can add other veggies for texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds red potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 bunches green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, then run under cold water until cool.</li>
        <li>Combine the sour cream and ranch dressing mix in a small bowl until well-blended. Transfer the potatoes, bacon, Cheddar cheese, and green onions to a large bowl. Stir in the sour cream mixture until well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for about 2 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
